## About

**Dakku** is a **physically based** renderer for the purpose of learning global illumination and ray tracing.   
Dakku is written in **modern C++** (>= 20) and integrates [embree](https://github.com/embree/embree) for high performance computing.   
The project structure is similar to [pbrt-v3](https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3) but the implementation is very different.
